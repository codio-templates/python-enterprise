# Ubuntu containers
Codio runs Ubuntu containers on AWS. Each project and assignment is it's own container so they can all have unique technology stacks installed. Install whatever you want using our sudo privelaged terminal using the standard Linux/Ubuntu instructions.

# Template Tool Chains with Stacks
Use a few different technology setups over and over again? Save your setup as a Stack and re-use with just a few clicks! You can then quickly update versions or add software to your Stack and all the content built on top of it will get the changes automatically.

Don't want to start from scratch? We have a library of pre-built common configurations:

# What about Graphical Output?
Codio uses Xserver to provide a virtual desktop that allows you to see graphical output from applications. You can even run graphical applications:

Working on a web project? Codio has a built-in browser that allows you to make changes and see updates side-by-side!

# Looks great -- but I don't have engineering time to build all this
No worries! Codio has a team of content developers who have experience in Codio, technology and education allowing them to create high quality, technical onboarding and upskilling content either from scratch or materials you provide.
